# Contributing to Git-Revisions project

## Documenting a feature issue:

- Fork the project on GitHub
- Clone the forked repository on your local machine
- Pick up an issue by assigning it to you
- Create a new feature branch (e.g: if you pick up feature about "Branches Managment" name your branch "feature/cheatsheet_branches-management")
- Document your feature by creating a file under the corresponding package (e.g: if it's a cheatsheet feature create a file named "branches-management.md" in the "cheatsheets" package)
- Push on your GitHub forked repository
- Create a Pull Request from your forked repository to the initial project
