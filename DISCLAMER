## These aren't the droids you're looking for...
Some git commands are very powerful but also very dangerous for your project.
Depending on your understanding and your experience in Git commands usage, they can be usefull or harmful.
If you don't master what you do, it's a bit like putting a lightsaber in the hands of an unprepared Padawan.

## More seriously:
This project is a set of cheatsheet files made by a student for revisions purpose. It's my understanding of Git command lines, processes, strategies and good practices. It is not an official documentation to follow blindly. If you're working in a company, follow your company guidelines. If you are studying as well, listen to your teacher/mentor/coach advices.

**Important!** Some of the Git command lines listed in the project are destructive and non-recoverable. I recommand not to copy/paste the command lines if you don't understand what they are doing and what are their effects on your Git project. If you're not 100% sure of what you are doing or don't understand what the command line make: **DON'T USE IT!**

**Thank you for reading!**
